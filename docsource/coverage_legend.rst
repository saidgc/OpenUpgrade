A module can have one of the following statuses:

* **Nothing to do**: Analyse has been done, and there is nothing to do or
  there's no change between the old edition and the new one;

* **Done**: Scripts are ready to run and can be found in this distribution;

* <Empty>: Not covered yet. Please see the 'openupgrade_analysis.txt' file
  of the module and start hacking the migration scripts!

You will always find migration scripts that are ready for review or
work-in-progress at https://github.com/OCA/OpenUpgrade/pulls. Please have a
look to see if you can help out.

In the table below, modules that are new in this release are marked with
